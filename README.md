1) Create a database in mongoDB or in any database you like 
2) I've created database using mongoDB and in my zip you will get the .env file and nessecary mongoDB url connections 
3) Then i have created RESTful api's using express 
4) There are all the major 5 apis for get all ,get by id,post , put by id , delete by id .
5) Schema has been set by using mongoose 
6) here i we have used a sample database and abstracted the data on the frontend using axios 
7) dependencies
   frontEnd :-
   >tailwind (here we are used cdn for tailwind it's not recommended for production level)
   >axios
   >react-icons
   backEnd :-
   >env
   >dotenv
   >cors
   >express
   >mongoose
   >nodemon

8) here i have developed components which show the data which we abstract 
9) to use this code you need to most importantly use the correct uri/MongoDBurl or the data won't be accessed 
10) check the script commands by default i have set both the terminal cmds to "npm run dev"
11) open 2 terminals 
12) cd ./frontend/               in terminal 1
13) cd ./backend/                in terminal 2
14) run the command "npm run dev" in both the terminals 
15) Ideally in the start the backend terminal first when it shows the msg the server is listen on port 
16) you can now use the frontend by run the cmd "npm run dev" in the frontend terminal 
17) hope it's works well for you ;)
